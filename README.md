<h1>What is Geocoding?!</h1>

<p>Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.</p>

<p>Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.</p>

<p>You can also use the Google Maps Geocoding API to find the address for a given place ID.</p>

<p>The Google Maps Geocoding API provides a direct way to access these services via an HTTP request. The following example uses the Geocoding service through the Google Maps JavaScript API to demonstrate the basic functionality.</p>
